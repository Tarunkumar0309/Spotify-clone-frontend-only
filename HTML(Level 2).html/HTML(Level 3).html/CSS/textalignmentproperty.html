    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated December 1962) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.

        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.</p>

        <h2>Early years</h2>
        <p>Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense. Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and horror comics.[9][12] Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date.[12] Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel changed it to gold because of issues with printing.[5] Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.[13]

            Once Marvel's distributor allowed the company more monthly releases, The Avengers (1963) was developed as a new comic book series.[14] Iron Man was one of the five characters who formed the titular superhero team.[15] By 1965, the difficulty of maintaining continuity between The Avengers and the members' solo titles prompted Lee to temporarily write the original cast out of The Avengers, including Iron Man.[16]</p>
            <h2>Characterization</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. As a child, he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, when his parents were killed in a car crash.[88] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[18][9] The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's publication history.[89] This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s,[90] and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.[91]

                Iron Man returns to the United States and becomes a superhero, convincing the public Iron Man is Stark's bodyguard.[88] When he is called to stop the Hulk and learns Loki is behind the Hulk's attack, he joins forces with the Hulk, Thor, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to defeat Loki, and they agree to form a superhero team, the Avengers.[15] He also helps found the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., providing the organization with equipment.[88] Iron Man then undergoes surgery to replace the damaged portions of his heart, eliminating the need for his prosthetic chest plate.[92] As he came to regret his involvement in weapons manufacturing, Stark Industries is changed to Stark International, an electronics company that emphasizes environmentalism and ending world hunger.[93][88] S.H.I.E.L.D. attempts to take over the business and revert it back to weapons manufacturing. At the same time, Iron Man is framed for murder. These stresses cause him to begin drinking, and he develops alcoholism.[94] Though he gets sober, he relapses due to a plot orchestrated by his business rival Obadiah Stane.[88] Iron Man briefly loses his company to Stane, passes the Iron Man mantle to his ally James Rhodes,[48] and becomes homeless.[92] After Stark recovers, Stane adopts an armored suit and becomes the Iron Monger before being defeated. Iron Man then founds a space technology company, Stark Enterprises. When Iron Man learns Justin Hammer had acquired the Iron Man armor's technology, he seeks out all the other armors. The resulting fights leave Iron Man a fugitive, leading him to fake his death and then describe himself as a new Iron Man.[88]
                
                When Iron Man is shot in the spine and paralyzed, he develops a new prosthesis that grants him mobility. This prosthesis is hacked and controlled remotely, causing neurological damage that appears for a time to kill him.[95] Rhodes temporarily becomes Stark's chosen successor as Iron Man. After returning, Immortus places Stark under his control and turns him evil. The Avengers bring an alternate Tony Stark from another reality to help defeat him. Iron Man is killed and the alternate Tony Stark becomes the new Iron Man, but Franklin Richards merges both versions into a single being when he rewrites reality. Stark's company is bought out at this point, so he starts a consulting firm, Stark Solutions. His secret identity is revealed to the public shortly afterward. He is then appointed Secretary of Defense until the Scarlet Witch alters his mind, causing him to behave drunkenly at the United Nations and leave in disgrace.[88] When Mallen becomes a threat through the Extremis project, Iron Man has Maya Hansen inject him with the Extremis virus, giving him a biological armor he can control with his mind.[96]
                
                Iron Man serves as the Superhero Registration Act's enforcer upon its enactment, creating a schism between superheroes, with Iron Man leading proponents of registration against a group of resistors led by Captain America.[67] After the conflict, Iron Man becomes head of S.H.I.E.L.D.[97] The government dismantles S.H.I.E.L.D. after it fails to prevent an alien invasion, but Iron Man refuses to turn over the list of registered heroes to its corrupt successor agency H.A.M.M.E.R.[98] This agency is dismantled as well, and Iron Man organizes the Avengers to replace these agencies.[88] He founds a clean energy company, Stark Resilient, and fakes his death so his enemies will not threaten it. He joins the Guardians of the Galaxy for a time, and upon returning to Earth, he discovers he had actually been adopted by the Starks so their biological son could be hidden from an alien threat.[99]
                
                While fighting Red Skull, a spell cast by Victor von Doom and the Scarlet Witch temporarily inverts the personalities of several heroes. The new morally-corrupt Iron Man protects himself from the counterspell and takes over San Francisco to augment the residents with Extremis.[100] When a man is discovered who can see the future, the superhero community undergoes another schism, and Iron Man leads a team of heroes opposed to a predetermined justice system based on his ability.[81] The battle ends with Iron Man in a coma. A reformed Victor von Doom becomes Iron Man, while an artificial intelligence backup of Stark's mind guides a new armored superhero, Ironheart. Stark resumes his work as Iron Man after the technology in his body allows him to heal.[99] He then allies with Emma Frost and marries her to set a trap for their mutual enemy Feilong.[101]</p>
                <h1>Themes and motifs</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Iron Man was more overtly political than other Silver Age Marvel characters.[129] Lee wrote the character to represent liberal capitalism, fighting against communism and other anti-democratic forces.[130][131][132] Though anti-communist sentiments were present throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man stories.[133] After Marvel shifted away from addressing foreign conflicts toward the end of the 1960s, Iron Man was portrayed as a liberal who was skeptical of the U.S. government, yet also opposed radicalism; at the time associated with 1960s counterculture.[134] Marvel portrayed Iron Man as more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is justified against communism.[135][136] By 1975, Iron Man opposed the Vietnam War,[134] which gave the character a new motivation in making up for his promotion of violence in the past.[137] Iron Man's use of his vast resources as a protector was reframed as a cautionary tale, in which these resources could be co-opted to do harm. His motivation for providing weapons to the government was retroactively changed so Stark only got involved because he believed it would end the war more quickly.[138] Over time, writers portrayed Iron Man as a philanthropist.[139]

                    The dual role of Iron Man and Tony Stark allows for examination of both the perspective of an individual inventor and that of the bureaucracy of governments and corporations, respectively.[140] His business Stark Industries is depicted as a force for good that advances scientific knowledge through capitalist innovation.[105] The Iron Man persona itself, as well as the technology Iron Man uses, are proprietary assets owned by Stark Industries.[141] Reflecting his characterization as a businessman, Iron Man stories often invoke themes of economic competition, seeing him face characters who try to develop better versions of the Iron Man armor.[142] Many of Iron Man's challenges involve corrupt business rivals and corporate espionage.[52]
                    
                    Technology
                    Technology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man stories,[29][143] and various writers have portrayed him as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances.[144] The character's use of technology, both as a weapons manufacturer and as Iron Man, explores problems that arise from progress and advancement,[145] including misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics.[146] Iron Man's position within the suit allows for discussion regarding automation versus human oversight of technology,[147] and it reflects the debate on how new technologies are incorporated into public and military use, including the use of exoskeletons and battle suits.[148] These technological themes are explored through a modern lens during the "Extremis" story arc, which incorporates the idea of human enhancement through biotechnology.[149][150]
                    
                    Depictions of technology in Iron Man stories have often endorsed its use to alter the natural world.[151] This is in contrast with Silver Age Marvel stories, where radiation and other technological advancements were portrayed as dangerous.[105][152] Iron Man's engineering talent is key to his heroism, unlike other heroes who use engineering to supplement superhuman abilities.[153] This makes it more plausible that something like Iron Man could exist in the real world, as it is only technological advancement that separates Iron Man from reality.[154][155] Iron Man's power of flight is especially significant in the technology's symbolism, as it associates traditional heroic imagery with a technological component, giving this power to a man who created it himself in a transcendental fashion.[156]</p>
